    errors:
      api_error: |-
        Vagrant returned an exception while calling the SoftLayer API.

        Exception class: %{class}
        Exception message: %{message}
      certificate_error: |-
        The secure connection to the SoftLayer API has failed. This is 
        generally caused by the OpenSSL configuration associated with
        the Ruby install being unaware of the system specific CA certs.
        
        Please ensure that the SSL_CERT_FILE environment variable is set
        with a path to a certificate authority.
        
        Linux example:

        export SSL_CERT_FILE=/opt/vagrant/embedded/cacert.pem

        Mac OS X example:

        export SSL_CERT_FILE=/Applications/Vagrant/embedded/cacert.pem

        Windows example:

        set SSL_CERT_FILE=C:\HashiCorp\Vagrant\embedded\cacert.pem
